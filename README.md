# Libft
In the first part of this project, we must re-code a set of the libc functions, as defined in their
man. Our functions will need to present the same prototype and behaviors as the originals.

In the second part of this project, we must code a set of functions that are either not included in the
libc, or included in a different form.

In the bonus part of this project, we must code a set of functions that will allow our to easily use our lists.
