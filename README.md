# Libft
### ***First part*** 

We must re-code a set of the libc functions, as defined in their man. Our functions will need to present the same prototype and behaviors as the originals.

### ***Second part***

We must code a set of functions that are either not included in the libc, or included in a different form.

### ***Bonus part***

We must code a set of functions that will allow our to easily use our lists.
